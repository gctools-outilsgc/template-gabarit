# Code Standards :tada:

## Intro :boom:

Here we will have a happy little intro about the purpose of this document :ok_hand:

## Codacy and Linters :muscle:

Here we will talk about [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/project/gctools-outilsgc/concierge/dashboard) and how we will use it.

Explain how it will run on each commit / pull request and must pass before we merge the pull request.
Explain how we have our own code standards configured in Codacy based on the documentation below.

I'd like to discuss how to use and install linters and configs for linters. Maybe I'll discuss that in each language section.
